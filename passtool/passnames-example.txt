# Some examples of what you can do with passtool. To try it, run:
#
# `passtool -f passnames-example.txt'
#
#
# You will need a wordlist before you can generate passphrases, for
# this run:
#
# `passtool -W [SOURCE...]'
#
# Where SOURCEs are plain or gzipped text files (as an example, try
# /usr/share/dictd/*.dz). The wordlist will be stored in
# ~/.passtool/wordlist.gz. You can also provide a
# ~/.passtool/blacklist.txt file to forbid the words you don't want to
# see.
#

# A simple identifier
bob1@example.com

# Get a passphrase instead
{*}bob2@example.com

# Add some specific options
{pwcls=up,lw,dg/pwmnc=4/pwmxc=12}bob3a@example.com
{pwcls=lw,dg}bob3b@example.com
{pwcls=op}bob3c@example.com # no seriously don't do this :)

# Make some permanent changes...
{push/*/ppcls=dg}
bob4a@example.com
bob4b@example.com

# ... and reset them
{pop}

# Let's try special forms
{passphrase}  # =yes
{!passphrase} # =no

# Make sure two equal idents produce the same password
bob5@example.com
bob5@example.com
{*}bob5@example.com
{*}bob5@example.com

# ... unless we add some salt
bob5@example.com/1
bob5@example.com/2
{*}bob5@example.com/1
{*}bob5@example.com/2

# Add a real name
bob6@example.com//Bob Renard

# Bob Seven's account at SGC
{pwcls=up,dg/pwmnc=40/pwmxc=40}bob7@example.com//Bob Seven

# Try various passphrase case styles (note that words and seps are not
# changed by this setting)
{*/ppcase=cap}bob8@example.com//Bob 8A
{*/ppcase=up}bob8@example.com//Bob 8B
{*/ppcase=low}bob8@example.com//Bob 8C
{*/ppcase=rand}bob8@example.com//Bob 8D

# And now for something completely different
{pwcls=lw/pwmnc=6/pwmxc=6}bob9@example.com/pepper/Bob Coyote # blah blah...
